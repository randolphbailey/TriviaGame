# Trivia Game
This is essentially a clone of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire game in which the contestant first won the million dollars.  Unlike the original game, users have 30 seconds to answer each question.  The "checkpoints" at $1,000 and $64,000 are also implemented.

## Technologies Used
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Docker/nginx/caprover for deployment
